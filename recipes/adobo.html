 <h2> Filipino Chicken Adobo </h2>
 <p>Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! 
    Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy,
     tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns.</p>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
    <li>soy sauce</li>
    <li>white vinegar </li>
    <li>onion and garlic</li>
    <li>peppercorns</li>
    <li>sugar</li>
    <li>bay leaved</li>
    <li>green onion</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl.
         Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side.
         Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. 
        Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar 
        and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn 
        heat down to medium high.
        Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add chicken smooth side down. 
        Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need
         to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, 
         until the sauce reduces down 
        to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
    <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let
     the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken
      to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
    <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.
