    <h2>Pork Sinigang</h2>
    <p>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. 
        This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. 
        Other proteins and seafood can also be used. 
        Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pork Belly</li>
        <li>Young tamarind </li>
        <li>Water Spinach </li>
        <li>String Beans</li>
        <li>Eggplant</li>
        <li>Daikon radish</li>
        <li>Long green pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Extract The Flavors From The Tamarind</li>
        <p>Once the flavors are extracted from the fruit, the solid parts of the tamarind need to be removed. Do this by running the water into a kitchen sieve or a strainer. I recommend squeezing the tamarind afterwards. 
            You will be surprised on how much flavors are left in the pulp.</p>
        <li>Boil The Tamarind Broth And Cook The Meat</li>
        <p>Traditional sinigang is cooked plainly by boiling all the ingredients 
            together. Start by pouring the tamarind broth (in step 1) into a 
            cookware of your choice. 
            Deep and wide pots are perfect for this.
            Boil the liquid and then add some onion and tomato. This will add 
            flavor to the broth. This is also the proper time to add the pork belly. 
            Make sure to cover your pot so that the liquid can boil quickly.</p>

        <li>Add The Vegetables Sequentially</li>
        <p>The first batch of veggies to add are daikon radish and eggplants. Some people also add their string beans at this point 
            if they want it to be extra soft later on. I prefer mine to be a bit crisp.</p>
        <p> After 5 minutes of cooking in low heat (above simmering temp), add the long green peppers, string beans, remaining tomatoes, 
            and okra and continue cooking for 3 minutes.</p>

        <li>Season It And Then Add The Remaining Ingredients</li>
        <p>There is one vegetable that needs to be added yet. I am referring to the
             water spinach. I personally add the stalk and leaves on the later part
              of the process to retain its freshness. It is important to serve the 
            soup right away (while piping hot) for best results.</p>
        

    </ol>

    <p>Bon apetit!</p>
